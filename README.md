# Random Programming Quote Action

Puts a random programming quote to your README! It is a fun little project built by myself to satisfy the desire to have a randomly selected programming quote being put into my profile README. Feel free to use it for your own profile readmes! <br>

## ‚öô Usage

Put this in your README (the `...` stand for preceding and subsequent readme content, please ignore that)

```md
...
<!--PROGRAMMING-QUOTE-BOT:start-->

<!--PROGRAMMING-QUOTE-BOT:end-->
...
```

**Do not place any content between these 2 comments as they WILL be removed by the GitHub action** <br>

After adding these comments, make a new [`yml`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-yaml-the-yml-file-format/) file in `.github/workflows` under your root directory. It can have any name that<br>

For the sake of this example, let's just name it `random_programming_quote_action.yml`<br>

Next, please put the following code in that file.

```yml
name: Random Programming Quote

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  putRandomQuote:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

```
