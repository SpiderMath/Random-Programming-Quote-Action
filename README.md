# Random Programming Quote Action

Puts a totally RANDOM programming quote to your README! This can be really useful for your Profile Readme.<br>

# âš™ Usage
Put this in your README (the `...` stand for preceding and subsequent readme content, please ignore that)

```md
...
<!--PROGRAMMING-QUOTE-BOT:start-->

<!--PROGRAMMING-QUOTE-BOT:end-->
...
```

If you are thinking about putting ANY content between these 2 comments, please do not, since they will be removed by the GitHub action<br>

Make a new file in `.github/workflows` under your root directory. The file name can be anything you wish to keep! The only requirement is that it **has** to be a `.yml` file.<br>

For the sake of this example, let's just name it `action.yml`<br>

Next, please put the following code in `action.yml`

```yml
name: Random Programming Quote

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  putRandomQuote:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Put a random random programming quote in README

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node Environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Update the README
        uses: SpiderMath/Random-Quote-Action@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          QUOTE_FONT_SIZE: 6
          GH_USERNAME: 'Readme Programmer'
          	COMMIT_MESSAGE: 'Updated the README with a new Programming Quote ðŸ’» '
```

> â„¹ The `QUOTE_FONT_SIZE` is the size of the font, in the form of h tags. h1 is the largest tag, h6 is the smallest. So if you want LARGE text, you will warn you use `1` or `2`. If you want a normalish size font use `5` or `6`<br>
Default is `3`

> â„¹ Also, you can change the `cron` parameter to change the duration till which you want to update the readme, this updates the readme every 30 minutes

> â„¹ You can also change the message shown on Commit, by putting COMMIT_MESSAGE as the text you want! Default is: 'Updated the README with a new Programming Quote ðŸ’» '

> â„¹ The parameter GH_USERNAME can be configured to other values too, which will be the name of the bot committing the Quotes to your Repo, feel free to customise it as you want ðŸ˜€
